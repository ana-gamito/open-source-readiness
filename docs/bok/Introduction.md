Here are some resources to help make this case:

Please help contribute to the knowledge base or help improve our resources for open source programs. Most OSR resources are collaboratively produced as open source projects, and we're always on the lookout for ways to enable participants to share knowledge and best practices in a form that's useful to their peers. 

If you have a project to propose, <a href="https://github.com/finos/open-source-readiness/issues">open a GitHub issue</a> and share your vision!

Alternatively, most pages have an "edit" button where you can propose changes to a page via the <a href="https://github.com/finos/open-source-readiness/pulls">GitHub Pull Request</a> process.
